## Installation
### How to view the .md file much better?
- To view the .md file much better in Visual Studio Code (assuming you use VSC), go to `Settings -> Extension` and search for **Markdown Preview Github Styling**. Install the extension and when you see a .md file, you can `right-click -> Open Preview`. That way you can view the .md file much better in your VSC.

## Current progress
- I've already prepared a draft for the [requirements](docs/requirements.md) document.
- I've also prepared a draft for the back-end implementation planning in this [back-end document](docs/backendDraft.md). (**PLEASE READ IF YOU'RE IN THE BACK-END TEAM**)
- I've prepared and initialised the backend folder with Azure Functions and testing folder for them.
## To-do
### **FOR EVERYONE**
- Please read the current [requirements](docs/requirements.md) and add requirements in there for the project.
### **FOR BACKEND TEAM**
- Please read the [back-end document](docs/backendDraft.md) and modify or add anything in it if needed.
- Open the README.md file in backend folder and complete the functions in the backend folder.
